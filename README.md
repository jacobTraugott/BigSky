## Configuring Expo

It is possible to run Expo!  Here are the setup steps:

* Change to the project root folder, i.e. ~/AFWERX-Mobile-ProgrammingCapstone/MTR_Scheduler_Mobile
* Run 'npm install'
* Then 'npm install expo'
* Followed by 'npm install expo-cli'
* And finally, 'npm start'

If the last step gives you a permissions issue, run 'sudo npm start' and that should work.
